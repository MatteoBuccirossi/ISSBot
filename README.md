# ISSBot
A twitter bot that replies to messages with information about th international space station, 
namely it replies to people with the next time it expects the space station to fly over a set of coordinates provided by the tweet.
I'm using node for this project, and the twit package; for the space station data I use the amazing open ISS api.
